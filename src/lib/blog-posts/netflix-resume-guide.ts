  content: `# Crafting the Perfect Resume for Netflix

Netflix is unique among tech giants for its culture of "Freedom and Responsibility." The company hires only high performers, pays top of market, and expects excellence. Your resume must demonstrate you're a stunning colleague who exercises great judgment. Netflix's approach to talent is radically different from most companies—they operate more like a professional sports team than a traditional corporation, constantly evaluating whether each person is still the right fit and paying top of market to retain the best. This means the bar for getting hired is exceptionally high, and your resume needs to prove you're not just good, but exceptional. Netflix values people who can work independently, make sound decisions in ambiguous situations, and deliver extraordinary impact. Your resume should tell a story of someone who thrives with freedom, takes ownership of outcomes, and consistently performs at the highest level.

## Netflix Culture: What Matters

### The 9 Behaviors Netflix Values

Netflix's famous culture deck outlines nine behaviors that define what they look for in every employee. These aren't just nice-to-have qualities—they're the foundation of how Netflix operates and what separates stunning colleagues from merely good ones. Your resume should demonstrate multiple behaviors through concrete examples and measurable achievements. Understanding these behaviors deeply and showing how you've embodied them throughout your career is critical to getting hired. Netflix interviewers are trained to evaluate candidates against these behaviors, and your resume should make their job easy by clearly highlighting relevant examples. Each behavior represents a different dimension of what makes someone successful at Netflix, and strong candidates demonstrate proficiency across all nine areas.

1. **Judgment** - Make wise decisions despite ambiguity. Netflix values people who can navigate uncertainty and make sound calls with incomplete information.
2. **Communication** - Listen well and communicate clearly. Effective communication across teams and levels is essential in Netflix's collaborative environment.
3. **Impact** - Accomplish amazing amounts of important work. Netflix expects exceptional productivity and meaningful contributions that move the business forward.
4. **Curiosity** - Learn rapidly and eagerly. Continuous learning and intellectual curiosity are valued as the streaming industry evolves rapidly.
5. **Innovation** - Re-conceptualize issues to discover solutions. Netflix wants people who think creatively and find novel approaches to problems.
6. **Courage** - Say what you think even if controversial. Speaking up and challenging ideas respectfully is expected and valued.
7. **Passion** - Inspire others with your thirst for excellence. Enthusiasm and commitment to doing great work are contagious and valued.
8. **Honesty** - Be candid and non-political. Direct, transparent communication without office politics is the Netflix way.
9. **Selflessness** - Seek what's best for Netflix, not yourself. Put the company's interests ahead of personal or team interests.

## The "Keeper Test"

Netflix asks: "If this person were to quit tomorrow, would we try to keep them?" Your resume must prove you're a keeper. This test is applied continuously to every employee, and it should guide how you frame your accomplishments. Show that you're someone any manager would fight to retain—someone whose departure would be a significant loss. Demonstrate that you consistently deliver exceptional value, raise the bar for those around you, and embody Netflix's culture so thoroughly that you'd be irreplaceable.

## Netflix-Specific Resume Tips

### 1. Show High Performance

Netflix only hires A-players and pays top of market to retain them, which means your resume needs to prove you're in the top tier of performers in your field. Don't be modest—Netflix wants to know you're exceptional and expects you to state it confidently. Show consistent high performance through promotions, awards, peer recognition, and quantifiable achievements that exceed expectations. Demonstrate that you don't just meet goals but consistently exceed them, often by significant margins. Netflix looks for people who deliver 2x or 3x the output of an average performer while maintaining high quality. Your resume should make it obvious that you're someone who raises the bar wherever you go and that losing you would be a significant setback for any team.

**Example:**
"Consistently rated top 5% performer. Promoted twice in 3 years (typically 4-5 year cycle). Received 'Excellence Award' for launching feature that became company's most-used capability"
