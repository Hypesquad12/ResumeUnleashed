  content: `# Crafting the Perfect Resume for Meta (Facebook)

Meta (formerly Facebook) is one of the most sought-after employers in tech, known for its innovative culture, competitive compensation, and mission to "bring the world closer together." With thousands of applications for each role, your resume needs to stand out immediately.

## Understanding Meta's Culture and Values

Meta operates on five core values that should be reflected in your resume:

1. **Move Fast** - Show you can execute quickly and iterate
2. **Be Bold** - Demonstrate willingness to take calculated risks
3. **Focus on Impact** - Quantify your achievements with metrics
4. **Be Open** - Show collaboration and transparency
5. **Build Social Value** - Highlight work that benefits communities

## What Meta Recruiters Look For

### 1. Quantifiable Impact

Meta is obsessed with metrics. Every bullet point should include numbers:

❌ **Weak:** "Improved application performance"
✅ **Strong:** "Optimized React components, reducing load time by 40% and improving user engagement by 25% for 2M+ daily active users"

❌ **Weak:** "Led product development"
✅ **Strong:** "Shipped 3 major features in 6 months, driving 15% increase in user retention and $5M in additional revenue"

### 2. Technical Excellence

For engineering roles, Meta expects:
- **Strong coding fundamentals** - Data structures, algorithms, system design
- **Relevant tech stack** - React, Python, C++, Hack, GraphQL
- **Scale experience** - Building systems for millions/billions of users
- **Open source contributions** - GitHub projects, community involvement

**Example Technical Resume Bullet:**
"Architected microservices infrastructure handling 50M+ requests/day with 99.99% uptime, reducing latency by 60% using Node.js, Redis, and AWS"

### 3. Cross-Functional Collaboration

Meta values engineers who can work across teams:
- Product managers
- Designers
- Data scientists
- Other engineering teams

**Example:**
"Partnered with PM and design teams to launch Instagram Stories feature, coordinating 8 engineers across 3 time zones and delivering 2 weeks ahead of schedule"

## Resume Structure for Meta

### Professional Summary (Critical)

Your summary should immediately communicate your level and impact:

**Software Engineer Example:**
"Full-stack engineer with 5+ years building scalable web applications at high-growth startups. Expertise in React, Node.js, and distributed systems. Shipped features serving 10M+ users with focus on performance optimization and user experience. Passionate about building products that connect people."

**Product Manager Example:**
"Product leader with 7+ years driving 0-to-1 products in social and marketplace spaces. Launched 4 products generating $20M+ in revenue. Data-driven decision maker with technical background and track record of 30%+ user growth. Aligned with Meta's mission to build community."

### Experience Section

**Format each role with:**
1. Company, Title, Dates
2. 1-line company description (if not well-known)
3. 4-6 bullet points with metrics
4. Technologies/tools used

**Example:**

**Senior Software Engineer | TechStartup Inc. | 2020 - Present**
*Series B social networking platform with 5M users*

• Architected and launched real-time messaging system handling 100K+ concurrent connections, increasing user engagement by 35%
• Reduced API response time from 800ms to 120ms through database optimization and caching strategies, improving user satisfaction scores by 28%
• Led migration from monolith to microservices architecture, enabling 3x faster feature deployment and reducing downtime by 90%
• Mentored 4 junior engineers, establishing code review standards that decreased production bugs by 45%
• **Tech:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, Docker

### Skills Section

Organize by category and prioritize Meta's tech stack:

**Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C++, Java, PHP/Hack
**Frontend:** React, React Native, Redux, Next.js, GraphQL
**Backend:** Node.js, Django, Flask, Express
**Infrastructure:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
**Tools:** Git, Jira, Figma, Analytics platforms

## Meta-Specific Resume Tips

### 1. Highlight Relevant Projects

Include side projects or open source work that demonstrates:
- Building at scale
- Social/community impact
- Technical innovation
- Mobile-first thinking

**Example:**
**Personal Project: Community Events Platform**
• Built React Native app connecting 5,000+ users to local events, featuring real-time updates and social sharing
• Implemented recommendation algorithm increasing event attendance by 40%
• Open sourced on GitHub with 200+ stars

### 2. Show Leadership and Initiative

Meta values "Move Fast" mentality:
- Led initiatives without being asked
- Unblocked teams
- Drove technical decisions
- Improved processes

**Example:**
"Identified performance bottleneck affecting 20% of users, proposed solution, and led implementation reducing complaints by 85% within 2 weeks"

### 3. Demonstrate Learning and Growth

Show continuous improvement:
- New technologies learned
- Certifications earned
- Conferences attended
- Technical talks given

### 4. Emphasize User Focus

Meta is user-obsessed. Show you understand users:
- A/B testing experience
- User research involvement
- Accessibility improvements
- UX optimization

**Example:**
"Conducted 15+ user interviews identifying pain points, leading to redesign that improved task completion rate from 60% to 92%"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Generic Descriptions
❌ "Responsible for building features"
✅ "Shipped 12 features in 6 months, each increasing user engagement by 10%+"

### 2. Missing Metrics
Every achievement should have a number. If you can't measure it, reconsider including it.

### 3. Outdated Technologies
Don't emphasize technologies Meta doesn't use. Research their tech stack first.

### 4. Lack of Impact Focus
Meta cares about outcomes, not activities. Focus on "what changed" not "what you did."

### 5. Too Long or Too Short
- 0-5 years: 1 page
- 5-10 years: 1-2 pages
- 10+ years: 2 pages maximum
