## What Big 4 Recruiters Look For

### 1. Academic Excellence

Big 4 firms have exceptionally high academic standards and use GPA as a primary screening criterion. Academic performance is viewed as an indicator of your ability to learn quickly, handle complex material, and maintain high standards under pressure—all critical skills for success in professional services. Your transcript demonstrates your work ethic, intellectual capability, and commitment to excellence. For entry-level positions, academic credentials often carry more weight than for experienced hires, but they remain important throughout your career. Strong academic performance also signals that you can handle the rigorous training programs and professional certification requirements that Big 4 firms expect. If you're pursuing or have completed your CPA, this demonstrates commitment to the profession and is often a requirement for advancement in audit and tax roles.

Big 4 firms have high academic standards:
- **GPA:** Minimum 3.0, competitive candidates have 3.5+
- **Relevant coursework:** Accounting, finance, economics, business
- **Certifications:** CPA (pursuing or completed), CFA, relevant licenses

### 2. Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills

Big 4 work revolves around analyzing complex business problems, interpreting data, and developing actionable recommendations. Your resume must demonstrate strong analytical capabilities through specific examples of how you've tackled challenging problems, analyzed data, and derived insights. Whether you're in audit (analyzing financial statements and controls), tax (researching complex tax issues), or consulting (solving business problems), analytical skills are fundamental. Show that you can break down complex issues, apply frameworks and methodologies, and arrive at sound conclusions. Quantify the scope of your analysis—the size of datasets, number of variables considered, complexity of the problem—and always tie your analysis to business impact. Big 4 firms value people who can think critically, identify patterns, and translate analysis into recommendations that drive value for clients.

Demonstrate ability to analyze complex problems:

**Example:**
"Analyzed financial statements for Fortune 500 client, identifying $5M in cost savings opportunities through process optimization and vendor consolidation"

**Example:**
"Led team of 4 analysts on due diligence project, coordinating workstreams, managing client relationships, and delivering comprehensive report 2 weeks ahead of schedule"

Consultants must communicate complex ideas clearly:

**Example:**
"Presented findings to C-suite executives, translating technical accounting issues into strategic recommendations that informed $50M acquisition decision"

Understanding of business and industry:

**Example:**
