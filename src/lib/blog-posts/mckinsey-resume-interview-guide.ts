  content: `# McKinsey Resume & Interview Preparation

McKinsey screens heavily for **impact, leadership, and structured problem-solving**. Your resume must read like a one-page “client-ready” slide: clean, quantified, and prioritized. This guide breaks down what to write and how to prepare for the interview flow.

## What McKinsey Looks For

### 1. Exceptional impact (numbers matter)
Recruiters want proof you moved a metric:
- revenue, cost, margin
- customer adoption, conversion, retention
- cycle time, error rate, productivity

### 2. Leadership + ownership
Not just “participated”—you drove decisions, influenced stakeholders, and delivered outcomes.

### 3. Structured thinking
Your bullets should reflect clear logic: problem → action → result.

## McKinsey Resume Format (Non-Negotiables)

- 1 page (most applicants)
- Simple, ATS-safe layout (no tables)
- Tight sections: Education, Experience, Leadership/Extracurricular, Skills/Interests

## Bullet Formula That Works

Use: **Action + lever + metric + scope**

Examples:
- Reduced weekly reporting time by 60% by automating KPI pipeline (SQL + Python); freed 8 hrs/week for 12-person team.
- Led pricing analysis across 4 SKUs; recommended tiering change that lifted gross margin by 2.4pp.
- Designed ops workflow redesign that cut customer onboarding TAT from 7 days to 3 days.

## Keywords That Fit McKinsey Recruiting

- stakeholder management
- problem solving
- hypothesis-driven
- analytics
- business case
- change management
- operating model
- pricing / growth
- cost optimization

## McKinsey Interview Process (Typical)

1. **Recruiter screen** (resume deep-dive)
2. **First round**: 2 interviews
   - Case
   - PEI (Personal Experience Interview)
3. **Final round**: 3–4 interviews
   - Cases + PEI with senior interviewers

## PEI (Personal Experience Interview): What to Prepare

McKinsey PEI is often more decisive than you expect. Prepare 3–4 stories that map to:

- **Personal impact** (ownership + results)
- **Inclusive leadership** (team conflict, influence without authority)
- **Entrepreneurial drive** (initiative, ambiguity)

Use STAR, but keep it crisp:
- Situation (10%)
- Task (10%)
- Action (60%)
- Result (20%, quantified)

## Case Prep: High-ROI Practice

- Master basic case math and clean structuring
- Practice 10–15 full cases
- Learn to synthesize in 30 seconds ("Therefore, I recommend…")

## 7-Day Plan

- Day 1: Rewrite resume bullets (10–12 quantified bullets)
- Day 2: Build 3 PEI stories + drill aloud
- Day 3: Case frameworks + market sizing drills
- Day 4: 2 full cases + refine math speed
- Day 5: 2 full cases + PEI mock
- Day 6: Final resume proofread + fit answers
- Day 7: Light practice + rest
